# TODO

- Copy images and video and link them
- Replace common urls shorteners links (buff.ly, tinyurl, etc.)
- Generate entries for liked tweets ? They are not included in archive, so requires querying Twitter API to get them.
  We could just generate link.
- Add media types to metadata file
- Add metadata to SQLite index at root dir.
- Write initial test suite
- Fix JS header removal to make it more generic (in case there is a part1, etc.)
