# TODO

- Render Youtube links
- Resolve twitter short url inside embedded tweets.
- Generate entries for liked tweets ? They are not included in archive, so requires querying Twitter API to get them.
  We could just generate link.
- Add media types to metadata file
- Add metadata to SQLite index at root dir.
- Rename media file to shorter / more friendly filenames.
- Write initial test suite.
- Refactor / clean-up
- Fix JS header removal to make it more generic (in case there is a part1, etc.)
- Convert smileys to Emoji
